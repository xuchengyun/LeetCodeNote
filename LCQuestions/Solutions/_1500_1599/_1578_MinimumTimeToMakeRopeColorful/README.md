# [1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful)

## Description

<p>Alice has <code>n</code> balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>colors</code> where <code>colors[i]</code> is the color of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> balloon.</p>

<p>Alice wants the rope to be <strong>colorful</strong>. She does not want <strong>two consecutive balloons</strong> to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it <strong>colorful</strong>. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>neededTime</code> where <code>neededTime[i]</code> is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> balloon from the rope.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum time</strong> Bob needs to make the rope <strong>colorful</strong></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg" style="width: 404px; height: 243px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;abaac&quot;, neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the above image, &#39;a&#39; is blue, &#39;b&#39; is red, and &#39;c&#39; is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg" style="width: 244px; height: 243px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;abc&quot;, neededTime = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg" style="width: 404px; height: 243px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;aabaa&quot;, neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == colors.length == neededTime.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= neededTime[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>colors</code> contains only lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>


## Solutions

<!-- tabs:start -->
### Solution 1 iterate thought list and maintain max for each group
for each group, we always record the largest removal time (Let's still call it currMaxTime for convenience) and add the other smaller removal times to totalTime. When we have another newly added removal time t[i] that belongs to the current group, we compare t[i] with currMaxTime, add the smaller one to totalTime, and leave the larger one as currMaxTime.
1. Initalize totalTime, currMaxTime as 0.
2. During the itertion over balloons, for each balloon i, it has color of colors[i] and removal time neededTime[i].
   - If this balloon is the first balloon of a group, we reset currMaxTime as 0.
   - Increment totalTime by the smaller one among neededTime[i] and currMaxTime, since we only remove the balloon with a smaller removal time.
   - Update currMaxTime as the larger one among neededTime[i] and currMaxTime.
3. Return totalTime as the minimum removal time.

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime) {
        // totalTime: total time needed to make rope colorful;
        // currMaxTime: maximum time of a balloon needed.
        int totalTime = 0, currMaxTime = 0;
        
        // For each balloon in the array:
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.length(); ++i) {
            // If this balloon is the first balloon of a new group
            // set the currMaxTime as 0.
            if (i > 0 && colors.charAt(i) != colors.charAt(i - 1)) {
                currMaxTime = 0;
            }
            
            // Increment totalTime by the smaller one.
            // Update currMaxTime as the larger one.
            totalTime += Math.min(currMaxTime, neededTime[i]);
            currMaxTime = Math.max(currMaxTime, neededTime[i]);
        }
        
        // Return totalTime as the minimum removal time.
        return totalTime;
    }
}
```
