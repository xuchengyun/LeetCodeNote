     * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
     * Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.
     * Example:
     * Input: s = "++++"
     * Output:
     * [ ",
     * "+--+",
     * "++--"
     * ]
